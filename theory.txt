The provided code snippet demonstrates how to use the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python with the following key components:

Importing Libraries:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares):

It measures the variance within each cluster. Lower values indicate better clustering.
Finding Optimal k Using the Elbow Method:

The loop calculates the inertia (sum of squared distances to the nearest cluster center) for k values ranging from 1 to 9 and appends the results to the distortions list.
A plot is generated to visualize the distortions against the k values to identify the "elbow," which indicates the optimal number of clusters.
Fitting K-Means with Optimal k:

After determining the optimal k, KMeans is applied to the dataset, and cluster labels are predicted.
Correlation Heatmap:

A heatmap of the dataset's correlations is plotted to visualize relationships between variables.
Example of Code Functionality
Here’s a breakdown of the important parts of the code:

Elbow Method:

python
Copy code
for k in K: 
    kmeanModel = KMeans(n_clusters=k) 
    kmeanModel.fit(df) 
    distortions.append(kmeanModel.inertia_) 
This loop helps to find the best number of clusters for your dataset.

Cluster Prediction:

python
Copy code
kmeanModel = KMeans(n_clusters=3) 
y_kmeans = kmeanModel.fit_predict(df) 
print(y_kmeans)
This applies K-Means with k=3 and prints the cluster assignments for each data point.

Correlation Heatmap:

python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize = (30,26)) 
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)
This visualizes correlations between features, helping to understand their relationships.

This method is effective for exploratory data analysis and helps identify patterns in data through clustering.

To classify emails as spam or not spam (binary classification) using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), follow these steps:

1. Data Preparation
Load the dataset, remove irrelevant columns (like Email No. if present), and separate features and target labels.
Prediction column typically serves as the target, where:
0 = Not Spam (Normal State)
1 = Spam (Abnormal State)
2. Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and test sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model
Initialize the KNN model, choosing a suitable number of neighbors (e.g., n_neighbors=7).

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data_sample.csv')
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Make sure to handle any missing values and select relevant features for clustering.

python
Copy code
# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Example of selecting relevant features
# Assuming 'Sales', 'Quantity' are important features for clustering
X = df[['Sales', 'Quantity']].dropna()
Step 3: Determine the Number of Clusters Using the Elbow Method
python
Copy code
# Using K-Means to find the optimal number of clusters
wcss = []  # Within Cluster Sum of Squares

# Loop through different values of k (1 to 10)
K = range(1, 11)
for k in K:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(K, wcss, 'bx-')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters (k)')
plt.ylabel('WCSS')
plt.title('Elbow Method for Optimal k')
plt.show()
Step 4: Implement K-Means Clustering
Once you determine the optimal number of clusters, fit the K-Means model.

python
Copy code
# Assuming the elbow method suggests 3 clusters
optimal_k = 3
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_k, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Add the cluster labels to the original dataframe
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_
Step 5: Visualize the Clusters
python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='Sales', y='Quantity', hue='Cluster', palette='viridis')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering')

K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering: An Overview
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on certain features. K-Means and hierarchical clustering are two popular clustering methods used in data analysis.

K-Means Clustering
Theory
K-Means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squared distances (within-cluster variance) between data points and their respective cluster centroids.

Steps
Initialization: Randomly select k initial centroids.
Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
Update: Calculate the new centroids as the mean of all points assigned to each cluster.
Iteration: Repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence (no change in centroids).
Elbow Method
The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). It involves plotting the Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against different values of k. As k increases, WCSS decreases, but the rate of decrease slows down. The point where this slowdown begins (the "elbow") suggests a suitable value for k.

Hierarchical Clustering
Theory
Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to represent data points and their relationships. It can be categorized into:

Agglomerative: Starts with individual data points and merges them into larger clusters.
Divisive: Starts with one cluster and divides it into smaller clusters.
Steps
Calculate Distance: Compute the distance (similarity) between all pairs of data points using metrics like Euclidean distance.
Linkage Criteria: Use methods like single-linkage, complete-linkage, or Ward’s method to determine how to merge clusters based on distance.
Dendrogram: Plot a dendrogram to visualize the merging of clusters. The x-axis represents data points, and the y-axis represents the distance at which clusters are merged.
Implementation
Data Preparation: Load the dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values and selecting relevant features for clustering.
K-Means Implementation: Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and apply K-Means clustering.
Visualization: Visualize the clusters to understand their distributions.
Hierarchical Clustering Implementation: Perform hierarchical clustering and plot the dendrogram to visualize cluster formations.
Summary
K-Means is efficient and works well for large datasets but requires the number of clusters to be defined beforehand. Hierarchical clustering provides a detailed view of data relationships but can be computationally intensive. Together, these methods can yield insights into data structure and patterns, assisting in decision-making processes.
